**Overview**

NeatCat is an engaging and interactive 2D logic game designed for children aged 4-6 years. The primary objective of the game is to help a cat navigate through various rooms in a house, collecting and placing items in their correct locations. The game features a playful environment, engaging animations, and a rewarding system with fireworks to celebrate correct item placements.

This game was inspired by my daughter's idea on our way home from kindergarten. I decided to bring her vision to life by creating this game.
